# 1. Indent your code correctly.
# 2. Use descriptive variable names, no xs, no ys, no thing
# 3. Don't use the return keyword. Ever. It isn't needed.
# 4. especially don't use return in loops.
# 5. Don't use ! methods, like collect! or uniq!

# 1. Instantiation and Saving Objectives
# 2. Class Variables
# 3. Class Methods
# 4. Enumeration - looping to find a match
# 5. Introduce a module to share this functionality with songs.
